# How to sort a Matplotlib Pie Chart
This is a simple example on how to order a Matplotlib pie chart (so that the slices are not large, then small, then large)

It makes it look better to have the data ordered descending/ascending by value. But it was a bit of a challenge because the labels and the values are two separate lists. To order them I first created a dictionary out of the dataset and then used that to generate the two ordered lists.
